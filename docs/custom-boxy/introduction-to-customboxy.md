# Introduction to CustomBoxy

{% embed url="https://pub.dev/documentation/boxy/latest/boxy/CustomBoxy-class.html" %}

[CustomBoxy](https://pub.dev/documentation/boxy/latest/boxy/CustomBoxy-class.html) is a widget that uses a delegate to implement a custom [RenderObject](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject-class.html).

This is essentially a more powerful version of [CustomMultiChildLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomMultiChildLayout-class.html) or [CustomPaint](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomPaint-class.html), it allows you to inflate, constrain, and lay out each child manually, it also allows its size to depend on the layout of its children.

This is overkill in most cases, so before diving in you may want to check if some combination of [Stack](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Stack-class.html), [LayoutBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/LayoutBuilder-class.html), [CustomMultiChildLayout](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/CustomMultiChildLayout-class.html), or [Flow](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Flow-class.html) is more suitable.
